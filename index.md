# My Game

My Game is a small pixel art RPG game developed with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript following the [Pizza Legends tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcjhmZ8oLT0r9dSiIK6RB_PuBWlG1KSq_) by [Drew Conley](https://www.youtube.com/@DrewConley). The repository is meant to serve as a reference to implement similar functionalities elsewhere.
